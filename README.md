# KTaNEfetch

## How to Use `ktanefetch.py`

1. Install [Python](https://python.org/downloads).
2. Download [`ktanefetch.py`](ktanefetch.py).
3. Run the following command in a terminal: `python3 -m pip install archey4 questionary`
4. Run the downloaded script.

In case that doesn't work...

1. Create a folder specifically for `ktanefetch.py`.
2. Within that folder, create a folder called `src`.
3. Put `ktanefetch.py` in the `src` folder.
4. Open a terminal within the first folder (just outside of `src`).
5. Run the following commands (note that there must be a space after `venv` for the first command):
```
python3 -m venv .
pip install archey4 questionary
```
